## 🏗️ Architecture

VidMax follows a clean **MVVM architecture** with a unidirectional data flow:

```
UI Layer (Jetpack Compose)
    │
    ▼
ViewModel Layer
    │
    ▼
Repository Layer
    │
    ▼
Data / Service Layer (MPV, MediaSession, ContentResolver)
```

**Tech Stack:**

| Layer | Technology |
|---|---|
| Language | Kotlin 100% |
| UI | Jetpack Compose + Material 3 |
| Architecture | MVVM + Clean Architecture |
| Primary Engine | Jetpack Media3 (ExoPlayer) |
| Secondary Engine | MPV (via JNI bridge) |
| Audio Session | Android MediaSession / AudioService |
| Build System | Gradle (Kotlin DSL) |
| CI/CD | GitHub Actions |
